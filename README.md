# IPS-UPS
This repository contains the data sets generated and analyzed for the metamodel based upscaling of Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition DetailS (IPS-SPREADS) as presented in the study Pietzsch et al. (2022, submitted). The contents of the directory and its folders:

- R script UPS.R: used to analyze the base data and model results of IPS-SPREADS; it also contains the developed metamodel (see the respective sections within the R script for further details)
- directory IPS-SPREADS: contains the model file of IPS-SPREADS, a model description (ODD protocoll) as well as the input (GIS data of the selected grid cells) and the model results
- directory data-cells: contains raw and processed data on all grid cells as well as the selected grid cells for simulation with IPS-SPREADS
- directory data-plots: conatins the results of the 20 year application of the developed metamodel
- directory kappa: contains the results of applying all metamodel variants for 2017 and 2018
